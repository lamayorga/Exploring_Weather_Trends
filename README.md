# Exploring Weather Trends
## Extracting Data from a Databse using SQL to Compare Local and Global Temperature Trends
In this project, weather trends in Austin, TX were analyzed and compared to global temperature changes. The goals of this project included: extracting data from a databse using SQL, creating a line chart with local and global temperatures, and making observations based on trends.

## Datasets
The data used in this project was provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). Similar historical weather trend data can be found on kaggle, i.e. [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data), for further exploration. 

## Software
Tools used:
* SQL
* Microsoft Excel

## Summary of Findings
1. Austin is 11°C hotter than the global average with consistently higher temperatures throughout the dataset.
2. Austin had a decrease in temperatures between 1829-1838. The reduced temperatures in Austin dropped an average of 11% compared to the 4% global decrease.
3. Austin saw a spike between 1950-1966. A 0.4% average increase was observed from 1950-1957 and a decreasing temperature was observed at a rate of 0.4% from 1958-1966. Austin’s temperatures returned to an average yearly increasing rate of 0.1% for the remainder of the dataset.
4. The overall trend for both Austin and Global temperatures is increasing at a rate of 0.05%. Hotter temperatures have been consistent for the past 174 years.
